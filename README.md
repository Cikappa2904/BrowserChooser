# BrowserChooser
Browser Chooser is a small utility made in .NET that when set as the default browser inside Windows Settings, prompt you for which browser to use to open any link you open outside of a browser.

### Supported Opeating Systems:

- Windows 11 (haven't tested it but it should work)
- Windows 10
- Windows 8.1 (haven't tested it but it should work)
- Windows 7 (on Windows 7 the Windows API used for selecting the browser doesn't actually show a list of all browsers but a list of all programs installed on the PC)

### Known Issues

- Browser Chooser doesn't show in the Uninstall a program list inside Windows Settings or Windows Control Panel
